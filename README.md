# CSharp-6.0-new-features
A bunch of working examples that present new features added in c*#* 6.0

There are two sets of examples: for **LinqPad 5** and for **Visual Studio 2015**.
In general, almost all examples contain the same functionality expressed in new and old way so that You might compare how the language changed with this release.

Originally the code was written in LinqPad and is only ported to VS. I had to provide the famous `Dump()` method from LinqPad and did it by using the idea presented on [CodeProject](http://www.codeproject.com/Tips/789481/Bridging-the-Gap-between-Linqpad-and-Visual-Studio).
